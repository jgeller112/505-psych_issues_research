Psychological methods keep evolving: psychology researchers constantly adopt new statistical methods, computational tools, and research practices. This course introduces the latest advances in research methods in psychological science through a series of discussions, tutorials, and seminars. Lectures are generally given by a guest speaker who introduces methodological and statistical issues relevant to psychology research. Tutorials provide students with the necessary skills to build reproducible and transparent research programs. For instance, students will learn how to use R, Rmarkdown and Git/GitHub. Finally, students take part in seminars, in which they discuss timely topics in psychological methods (e.g., reproducibility, transparency, and pre-registration).
