# A tutorial on how to do X in R

Your final project is due the last week of the semester

For your final project you will create a tutorial about how to something in R.The final project gives you a chance to pursue any topic in the R universe and learn more about it. For example, you could choose to write a tutorial on any R package or how to perform a statistical analysis.


## Part 1: Give a 5 minute presentation

As a part of your tutorial, you will give a 5 minute presentation to the class summarizing the tutorial. 

## Part 2: Write a tutorial

The main part of the final project will be fo you to write a tutorial exploring how to do X in R. You will write an .Rmd file, that explains the issue, and gives example code showing how to solve the issue, or approach the issue. The process of writing a tutorial is a great way to learn the issues at hand yourself.

All of the tutorials will then be compiled together in a web-book using the bookdown package for posterity. 

I expect the tutorial to be comprehensive enough to demonstrate that you have delved into the topic. The length of the tutorial should be consistent with the length of a final paper in a typical content course.
