# Title 

Better Inference in Psychological Science: Test Less, Estimate More

# Abstract
The estimation approach to inference emphasizes effect sizes, confidence intervals, meta-analysis, and the use of Open Science practices.  Emphasizing estimation over testing could improve inference in psychological science: by nudging researchers away from invalid interpretations of tests, by providing a more straightforward way to plan for sensible sample sizes, and by providing a framework for fair testing.  In this seminar Iâ€™ll illustrate the benefits of estimation thinking with examples from the literature on oxytocin and trust, a research area that typifies some of the endemic problems that arise with poor statistical practice.
