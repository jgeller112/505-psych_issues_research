Why R?

+ Free and open-source

--
+ Flexibility

--
+ Programming language (not point-and-click)

--
+ Excellent graphics (via `ggplot2`)

--
+ Easy to generate reproducible reports (markdown and quarto)

--
+ Easy to integrate with other tools and programs
--

+ Inclusive Community


???

R was created in early part of 1990s. Is free and open source. What does that mean?
Open to everyone. Anyone can contribute. I have a package called gazeR. There is a package for lots of things you make want to do.

# Assignment of Variables

- A variable is a symbol that stands for another value (just like “X” in algebra)

```{r}

x <- 4

x

```

--
- The arrow `<-` is called an ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR, and tells R to save an object called x that has the value of 6. This is similar to saving a value in a graphing calculator.

- Can use `=` if you want 
--

```{r}

x + 7 

```


---

# Vectors

- Think of it as a row or column in a spreadsheet 

- Allows multiple types of classes to be concatenated together

    -  Numeric 

```{r}

x <-  c(2,6,16)

x

```

    - `x` here is called an object
--
 - Logical (TRUE/FALSE)
 
```{r}
x[1]==2
```

---

# Vectors

- Character
    
```{r}
x <- c("cat", "bat")

gender <- c("male", "female")
```

- Factors

- Turn character strings into specific categories

```{r}

gender <- as.factor(gender)

gender

```

- Logical vectors

```{r}

x==7

```

---
# Indexing

- Vectors can be indexed 

```{r}

x[1] # retreve first
x[2] # retreive second

x[-2] # everythin but that numbe 



```
--

- Change values in vector

```{R}

x[1] <- 7

x
```


---
# R as a Calculator

- Typing in a simple calculation show us the result

```{r}
608+ 28

```
--
```{r}
11527-283

```
--
```{r}
# divison
400/65
#multiplication
2*4
#exponentiation
5^2
```

---

# Functions

- Take an object, do something to it, and return the result

- More complex calculations can be done with functions:

  - What is square root of 64?

```{r}
# sqrt function
# in parenthesis: what we want to perform function on
sqrt(64)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}

sr=function(a, b){
  
  a=x
  b=x
  
  c=a + b
  return(c)
}

sr(2,3)
```
---

# Arguments 

- Some functions have settings
(“arguments”) that we can adjust:

- `round(3.14)`
  - Rounds off to the nearest integer (zero  decimal places)
  
- `round(3.14, digits=1)`
  - One decimal place

# Getting Help

1. Help files

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  out.width = "100%"}

knitr::include_graphics("help1.jpg")

# Exercises

1. Open a blank new script  

1.1 File -> New File > R Script

1.2 Ctrl + Shift + N 

1.3 Click on new script icon

2. In one of these scripts type "Hello World" 

3. To paste strings together you can use the `paste`() function (e.g., paste("Hello", "World")). Use ?paste or Google "paste function in R" to get an idea of how to use this function. 

3.1 Use the `paste` function to string together a sentence of your choice. Assign it to a variable or object. 

5. Modify the function above and instead of returning the sum return the product.

# Tidyverse and Pipes

- The `tidyverse` is an ecosystem of R packages designed for  data science. All packages share an  underlying design philosophy,  grammar, and data structures.

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  out.width = "40%"}

knitr::include_graphics("hex.png")
```

# Installing Tidyverse

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  out.width = "40%"}

knitr::include_graphics("cran.png")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}

install.packages(tidyverse)
```

- Load package

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```
---

# Pipes

- `tidyverse` provides another interface to functions—the pipe operator

  - Makes code easier to read and follow: 

- This: 

```{r,eval=FALSE}

a %>% 
  round()
```

--

- Can be converted into: 

  - Start with a and then round
  
-  `|>` pipe is slowly becoming more popular

---
# Multiple Functions

- Pipe operator makes it easy to do multiple functions in a row

```{r, eval=FALSE}

-16 %>% 
  sqrt() %>%
  abs()
```

- What is this doing?

# Reading in Data


- Download the file

```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  out.width = "100%"}

knitr::include_graphics("readr.png")
```
- General form: dataframe.name <-read.csv('filename')
---
# Data Frames

> A data frame is like an Excel spreadsheet. It is two-dimensional with rows and columns. 

  - Instead of creating a number of vectors we store all the vectors into a single DF
  
  - Can store numeric data (phone number, postal code, coordinates, etc.), float data (internet IP address, etc.), logical data (wants to receive ads: FALSE/TRUE, etc.), etc.

  
```{r}

car_model <- c("Ford Fusion", "Hyundai Accent", "Toyota Corolla")
car_price <- c(25000, 16000, 18000)
car_mileage <- c(27, 36, 32)

cars_df <- data.frame(model=car_model, price=car_price, mileage=car_mileage)

flextable::flextable(cars_df)%>% flextable::autofit()


```

---

# Tibbles

- More modern take on Data frames

  - Never changes input's type
  - Never adjusts the names of variables
  - It evaluates arguments lazily and sequentially
  
- Differences 
  - Printing
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}

as.tibble()


```
---

# Matrix

- Let's talk about the `[ , ]` 
- `[row, column]` to *subset* or grab specific values

```{r}
myMatrix <- matrix(data = 1:10,
                   nrow = 5,
                   ncol = 2)
myMatrix
```

---
# Working Directories

## `Here` package

- `Here` helps set relative as opposed to absolute paths

  - Why would this be a problem?

```{r, eval=FALSE}

#setwd("your path here")

```
  
--
```{r, out.width="50%"}
#install here
library(here)

# here

here::here()

# can use with read.csv
```

---
# Loading the Data

> Disclaimer: `Create new project folder first, open up R second`

The faculty dataset contains aggregated data per faculty:

- faculty: Business, Economics, Political Science, Sociology
- students: number of students
- profs: number of profs
- salary: amount of salary
- costs: amount of costs dataset entails demographic and school-related information on imaginary students, such as

# Exercise

1. Create a variable called y with the value of 7

2. Save the results of 6 + 3 as a variable called a.

3. Create a new project folder for this course entitled "psy_505" (run the .Rproj file)

  3.1 Place the exercise.csv file in the folder
  
5. Using here assign the file to a name of your choice

7. Explore the data set by running the commands head(data), str(data), glimpse(data) and summary(data) in your R script. You will use these a lot in the future, so have a closer look at the different outputs in the console (lower left). Remember to save your script!
