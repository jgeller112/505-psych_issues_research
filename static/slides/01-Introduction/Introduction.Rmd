# Course Format

- Extension of PSY 503

-   **Discussions.** Students will participate in discussions on various research issues. We will have several articles to discuss. These will be lead by students in the class. Please come prepared with questions and thoughts. 

-   **Guest Seminars.** Students will attend a series of lectures during the semester. Lectures may introduce a recent methodological contribution or discuss a controversial and easily overlooked issue regarding the application or interpretation of statistics. Lectures will be given by guest speakers who are expert in the topic.

-   **Tutorials.** Students will learn skills to build reproducible and transparent research programs. These tutorials may teach students how to preregister their studies, run power analyses, and organize their code with Notebooks). Tutorials may be given by guest speakers who are expert in the topic.

Once during the semester you (possibly in a pair) will be
responsible for leading discussions with that week’s signed reading or guest. Your job will be easier if everyone jumps in and asks questions, but if the discussion is lagging, you’ll jump in with some prepared questions for the speaker.
